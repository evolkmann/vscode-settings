A collection of my personal [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
settings and snippets.

## Where are my settings?

If you are using macOS your settings are located in

`/Users/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/Library/Application Support/Code/User/`

Since this is a hidden directory, you may want to use a tool like
[HideSwitch](http://www.creativecag.com/pages/software).
